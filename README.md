Hi, I'm Christian Dadap these are the steps I take to build the simple ci/cd pipeline.

1. I searched for readily available repo from github that can be forked. This is what I have found.
2. Created a folder .github/workflows
3. Created a deployment file named deploy.yml
4. Edit the deploy file to a sample deployment ci/cd using github actions
